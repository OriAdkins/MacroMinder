# COP4521_Project

## Project Overview
MacroMinder

A Web App to track your macros and habits through the week!

## How to run
First Steps
  Pull up the project in a terminal
  Navigate into the server folder
  Type .\venv\Scripts\activate into the command line
  You should be in the virtual environment. Now, we need to install flask. Type pip install Flask into command line
Run
  To start up the backend, make sure you’re in the serverfolder and type python server.py into the commandline
  To start up the frontend, make sure you’re in the client folder and type “npm start” into the command line
    This should open up locally in your default browser. The line "proxy": "http://localhost:5000", in package.json opens it up locally in port 5000
*After everything is set up, every time you want to run this project you only need to get into the venv by activating the scripts. You do not need to install flask every time you want to run this project. Just .\venv\Scripts\activate and npm run.*
Stopping
  In the backend, type deactivate to get out of the venv. In the frontend, just ctrl+c
